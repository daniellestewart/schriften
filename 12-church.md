# The Dreams

In one week, I had three dreams that all took place in a very typical unnamed American church building. Here are the dreams.

## 1. The Full Bathrooms
I was going to church. When I got there, I had to pee so I went into the women's bathrooms. They were an extension of the altar. The bathrooms were *huge* and many many people were in them. Rows of toilets lined the walls and there were no dividers or walls between them. Women were sleeping on the toilets, as if they'd been sitting for so long, they fell asleep there. I wondered if they listened to the sermons from in here. I really didn't want to stay.

I tried to leave and opened a door that wasn't latched close. It was the men's bathroom and was also full. Some men milled about aimlessly, others were also sleeping on toilets.

### Interpretation

I asked Holy Spirit, "why dreams of churches and bathrooms?" He responded,

> Look around you. So many of my people stay in a place of purging their sin. To Me, sin is like refuse and manure. Many people consume sin, digest it, then expel it at what they believe is My throne. It really is their throne. They remain there and become comfortable continuing to consume, digest, and expel, thinking that they are holy and righteous by doing so. They don't even know what holiness means. They sleep on their own thrones and I turn My face from them.
>
> The altar is no longer Mine. 

## 2. The Toilet Seat

[In waking life, I've been listening to a preacher named Corey Russell. He is an intercessor and is preaching to wake up the church into our calling as ministers to Yahweh.]

Corey Russell was staying in a shack in the forest. It was bear season and grizzlies were all over in the woods. (As in, hundreds everywhere you look.) I walked into the shack and Corey handed me a toilet seat. He explained, "It has a cold water reservoir. When you are done, push the handle and the cold water cleans you. Flip the lid."

I flipped the lid as he commanded and the lid played a cheesy sounding jingle: "Flush the toilet before you go! Get up! You are clean and you can leave!"

### Interpretation

I asked, "Why the bidet, Corey Russell, grizzlies, and the flushing jingle?" He responded,

> Clean up, flush, and be done in the toilet! Stop consuming sin and you'll not have to clean up again. My blood was shed so that sin has no power over you. My forgiveness brings you to My actual throne. My living water is here for you and reserved for My people. The jingle is a reminder: flush before you *go*. Get rid of what rots in you and don't sit there wallowing in it.

>Corey Russell is preaching this message and dragging My people out of the bathroom. As you listen to him, pay attention to the scriptures that say this very thing. 
>
The enemy surrounds as grizzly bears. From afar, they look cute and cuddly. They roll, play, and look pleasing. But once you are near and in its grip, it rips you into pieces. Take care not to see sin as anything other than disgusting and dangerous.


## 3. Umbrellas and Sugar

I was sitting in a church service. The seats were organized underneath large umbrellas. The people sitting under the umbrellas all had their computers and phones out. It was raining, but no rain touched the people or their devices.

The altar was lined with tables filled with sweet treats. Buckets of ice cream, stacks of ice cream cones, sprinkles, cakes, cookies, caramels. At the edge of the altar was a powerball machine for prophecies. A woman dressed beautifully pulled out a ball from the machine. Some lucky winner got a prophecy!

The 'worshippers' on stage wore really fancy attire, like what you'd see at a dinner theater show in Nashville or Branson. Green and black suitcoats, lime green pants, very flashy. Their dance moves reminded me of '80's pop music videos.

As I watched the people, I could see so much anger and bitterness between them. As they shoved ice cream into their faces, their eyes looked rageful and they'd throw mean glares at others.

### Interpretation

This one was particularly disturbing to me. As I was in the dream, I was so torn between wanting the sugary treats, wanting my name to be drawn in the prophecy lottery, and wanting to get out as quickly as I could.

There was an understanding imparted to me upon awakening, and I will try to articulate it well. It wasn't in words, it was in images, feelings, and knowing. Just as I have said before, this is not a judgement on all church congregations nor all individuals. I know He is preparing His bride, and while this dream does not represent His entire bride, it does represent people who will be freed from this prison and become His bride. I use these dreams to help me know how to pray for and love His church. I believe before His judgement comes, He reveals things to His people (Amos 3:7 and *many* others) so that we can interceed and understand.

- The altar: In the dream, the altar was not unto Him, but only gave us what our bodies and minds craved. Can we be undone at His altar? An altar was a place of sacrifice, blood, and water. Is that still what it is to us? Can we kill our pride there? Can we sacrifice what we look like to others? Can we say no to our bodies and minds and sit at His altar, understanding that we no longer live, but it is Christ who lives in us? Or would we rather feed our flesh and feel really good in the moment?

- Rain and umbrellas: Despite Him sending His rain, we cowered underneath umbrellas made of human pride so that we can protect that which we love and has our gaze and attention -- the devices. His rain is costly and will wash us from those things that so easily enrapture us. One raindrop will disintegrate our bond to what the world offers us, but it is so hard to let go of that bond. So we cower under the umbrella while simultaneously singing, "Send Your rain..." He already has.

- Powerball prophecy: In the dream, we turned His gift into a sideshow lottery. Only the special winners get the word from God! Will you be next? Stick around and find out!  The words become twisted by our pride and indulgence and do not accurately speak from His heart anymore. They are feel-good words that we call 'encouragement', but only manage to keep the receiver appeased, eating the cakes, and sitting under their umbrella. How painfully tragic that we have used gifts given by the Great I AM as a sideshow. His heart breaks and burns with jealousy.

- Worship: The stage. The lights. The smoke. The loudspeakers. The flashy outfits and perfect makeup. We were not worshipping, we were performing. The 'worship leader' was only a star. We vote on the worship song of the year and think that the award we receive is something other than a golden calf. We line the entrance to the Holy of Holies with merchandise and posters. We forgot that worship is ministry to the heart of Yahweh. It is not for us to feel good. It is not an incantation that results in summoning His presence. He is not a God to be summoned by a pretty voice, a minor key, and oh-those-lyrics. He does not respond to spells and tricks. His eyes go to and fro across the earth, looking for those who meekly and humbly seek Him.

Bitterness: "By this all people will know you are My disciples, if you have love for one another." John 13:35. There is nothing more that needs to be said.

I repent for His people. I repent for my own sin, pride, and selfishness. I repent for the times when I tried to worship Him and gave up because I felt nothing. I forgot that it isn't about me. I repent for the times that I have lost my peace and sat there on the toilet of my own condemnation, wallowing in sin. I insulted His blood that day. 

Along with the understanding He gave me with this dream, I also caught glimpses of His heart and feelings about it all. While He is heartbroken, He also sees that judgement is needed to wake up those few who will still respond to His call and willingly step into His rain. I pray that He is merciful in His judgement and that He judges me now.
