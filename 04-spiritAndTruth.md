# Spirit and Truth
John 4:23-24

> But the hour is coming and now is when the true worshippers
> will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father
> is seeking such to worship Him. God is Spirit. And those who
> worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.

I had been pondering these verses in days prior, but this day,
I was not thinking of this, rather just laying my head on the
chest of Jesus and visiting about many things. Most of them
fairly normal, not necessarily deep.

He asked me if I wanted to see a being that speaks one
of the languages He gave to me. Of course, yes.

I began to speak this language. I have many, most of which I can
only tell apart based on how they feel in my mouth. I don't usually
pay close attention to them, but I appreciate them for what they are.
This evening, however, I recognized this
language. It has a deep beauty to it, and I always love when this one
comes out.

I watched this creature well up in front of me. It was made of light -
a liquid light of many colors, mostly silver. It welled as if it
was rising, but it continually welled. It did not stop moving like that.
Flashes of faces were within the movement. Human, bull, human, dragon,
something else altogether unrecognizable.

It welled.

Then my words changed tenor. I could see darkness around the creature start
to move back as it welled up.
I aimed my words at the darkness. An appendage of the creature shot out -
almost like an octopus tentacle. When it touched the dark presence, the
darkness completely disintegrated.

The being continued to well, its tentacle of light back within
its moving form.

Then I began to sing in its language. As I sang, it rose and spread out
over a very massive area. Its liquid light "body" began to morph into
shapes that told a story.

Jesus dragging a cross. Soldiers swinging a hammer. A violent raising into
the hole. Blood running down, touching the earth.
Trickling, pooling, spreading across the entire earth - the entire realm -
all the realms. The sadness of this being was so very great. A broken heart
above all other brokenness it had ever felt.

Then... death.

This being suddenly began to *shake* vibrate *shake* tremble *shake* pulse
from its very depths. It raced to the Throne as quickly as possible and
shook even more.

It burst into worship at the brilliance and glory and perfection and
beauty of the cross and death and conquering and forgiveness and THE
PLAN that was kept secret.

The being then spoke to me,

> And that was when I became undone for Him. I worshipped Him with all that
> I was.

I could see the shaking become a shattering. The creature shattered
into billions of shards of liquid light crystals.

> And at the same time, His love wove me back together. And I came undone
> again. And He wove me back together. I've been worshipping like this ever
> since.

I was in awe at the dance between this creature and Father. Then the
creature asked me,

> Do you worship Him like this?

I replied,

> I try... but I don't know how. I am not there yet.

The creature said:

> Worship Him in spirit and truth. These are twin mountains that you must
> climb simultaneously.

I could see two massive cliffsides against each other. A very narrow crevice,
ran between them. At the crevice, it was a nearly vertical climb.
But away from the crevice, the cliffs were beyond vertical. If one climbed
spirit by itself, they would surely fall. If one climbed truth by itself,
they would surely fall. The only sure route to get higher was one foot
on each side.

I began to climb as I sang to Father. I took only a couple small steps.

I looked over and saw someone fall from spirit. They hit the rocks below.
Angels were down there caring for the fallen and helping them find the
right path. The being spoke:

> He is so very merciful. You see, they tried to worship Him. He cares
> very much that their heart is right before Him. It is a mercy that
> they cannot climb far before finding correction.

I looked up. The tops of the mountains were not visible from where I was,
but I went up higher with my eyes. (I didn't climb, I
just saw the top.) Bright blinding light at the Throne of Yahweh. Complete
and utter undoing in worship. I saw the creature there, worshipping Father.

I told Jesus how incredible that was. He responded,

> I gave you that language for a reason. One day, you will make it to the top
> and will worship next to that creature. You will dance together that
> dance of undoing and complete abandon. Father will join in the dance and
> knit you back together again.

I thanked Him for an amazing treasure in this language and all the others. He said,

> When you speak this language, this light wells up and darkness trembles.
> When his arm reaches out, darkness disintegrates. When he tells his story
> of Me, atmospheres change.

Worship Him in spirit and truth. I am still learning what all this means.
