# Desiring Gaze


A dream.

A man I care about wanted to see sanpaku eyes (very alluring eyes where you can see the whites below the iris), so he found a woman who had eyes like that and brought her into a garage. The garage was dank and dark. I'd never been in such a garage before. The man laid the woman over a block of wood and chopped off her head. He held her head in his hands and looked deeply into her eyes.

I did not want to look and I did not want to be near this man. He made excuses why it was really okay, and I recoiled from them all. He offered to show me and share it with me. I declined and felt sick. I told him I needed to go. He asked me to please stay, that it was dark out there. Emphatically, I assured him that I HAD to leave and just be with Holy Spirit right now. I left him in the garage as he still held the woman's head.

I got into my car and cried with Holy Spirit.

## Interpretation

What did this man represent in the dream? [It was a man who is close to me, so this part of the dream was hard for me to analyze. The more I know someone, the harder it is to separate elements of the dream from the person, especially when the dream is so dark like this one.]

> He represents My people who have a call on their life, but are clinging to the world and sin. They want both the eyes of the world and the heart of heaven. You cannot have both.

Why sanpaku eyes?

> The desiring gaze can be seductive. The gods of this world twist minds and eyes to seek the desire of another. Many truly crave being gazed upon. This is how you were created - I made you to want My gaze upon you. However, few look to Me to fulfill. Rather, they look to others, both human or nonhuman (like money or fame). Too many of My people desire to be desired by the world.

So then cutting off the head represents keeping the gaze close and for yourself, even if it is dead and lifeless?

> Yes, and more. They kill what gazes upon them so as to try and capture the gaze. This is a great and repulsive sin in My eyes. I do not want to see it. I recoil.

What do you mean: "kill what gazes upon them"? Will you give me an example?

> Once upon a time there was a man who wanted a woman to love him. He manipulated so that she would stay looking at him longer. One day, her gaze fell to another. the man was enraged and cut off her head, nailing it to his wall. Here she would always look upon him.

That was... really similar to the dream. It reminds me of Uncle Rico in Napoleon Dynamite. He killed high school football and hung the head on his wall so that it would continue to gaze upon him, right?

> That is one example, yes.

So, back to Your people. How do we do this? What does it look like coming from Your people compared to the world?

> It looks no different.

(I then saw an image of a man praying at a pulpit, as if preparing for service. A beautiful dove descended on him. He rejoiced and held the dove in his hands, but the dove wanted to move. He gripped tighter and tighter until he killed the dove. He then pinned the dead dove, with its wings spread, behind his pulpit.)

That is really disturbing, Holy Spirit... Is that what people do to You? 

> At times, yes. Of course it is a metaphor for killing my movement, freedom, and relationship with Me.

So Your people at times seek the gaze of the world or worldly things. Other times it is You they seek, but not a living relationship, just a dead memory.

> That is a good way to put it.

It was so horrible in the dream, I wanted nothing to do with it.

> That is how I feel. Sometimes My people want to share it with Me. This is not something I can nor want to do. If you do not hate the world, you cannot be My disciple. If you are friends with the world, you are My enemy.

> Will you help Me show them what devotion looks like? What singlemindedness looks like? What a pure imagination and clean eyes costs? And what it is like to capture My gaze?
