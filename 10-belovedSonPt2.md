# Beloved Son, Part 2

## Vision

The first night that I meditated on this verse, I knelt before Him and I asked Him:

I don't want to sit and fight these images in my mind. They are lies and you have defeated lies already. Will you give me another vision to replace that old one? Then whenever I think on this verse, I will not see the old, but just the new.

Then I opened the eyes of my heart and began to speak the verses. As I did, my imagination was totally and completely *there*. I saw John baptizing people in a river. I could see myself walking up to John and hear his words, saying that he was not worthy. I realized I was seeing this from Jesus' perspective. I continued and could see myself going underwater. When I looked up and began to rise out of the water, the sun glittered on the surface of the waves above me. Then Holy Spirit descended. He was beautiful alighting on Christ. The Father's voice spoke from heaven and shook Jesus to his very core.

It was beautiful to see, but I felt none of the emotions that Jesus would have been feeling. It was very simply a new image to replace the old -- understanding and not experience. However, I was incredibly thankful and told Him so. The vividness of these images was immediately far greater and more significant than the old vision. I knew that as the week continued, the feelings would come. For now, the image was enough. I did not have to fight, He just gave it to me. He is so good to me.

Throughout the week, every time I thought on this verse, it was like a forked path in front of the eyes of my heart. I could choose. Every single time, I chose to give Him my imagination and my heart's eyes. Without struggle, the vision was replaced.

## Identity

A few nights later, I sat with Father. He asked me, "Would you like to see something?" Of course, I always say yes to this question. He held me and began to move (or possibly what was beneath us was moving away). I could only see small glimpses of activity, movement, and faces in layers beneath us. It was moving quickly (or we were), and the images were not clear nor were they meant to be seen in detail. I knew it was events in time and we were going backwards.

We went beyond the faces of men and beyond the epochs of the earth. When we stopped, I could see the Father and the Word with Breath of Fire connecting them. They were not clear in their forms, I just knew that was what I saw. Around them was patterned chaos, swirls of light, and possibly nascent forms. It is very difficult to describe.

Father was holding something - stretching it out and forming it. I knew it was the foundation of the earth. He smiled to Himself and whispered as if thinking aloud.

"Danielle, I will love you. I love you. I've always loved you. That is who you are. Loved by your God, your Judge, your King, your Yahweh. That is who you are."

And with that, all power that vision had over me to dictate my identity was completely and utterly smashed into dust and thrown into the streets. All of the words spoken over me and deeds done to me that shaped my identity were as nothing. His words were spoken so far back in time that I cannot comprehend it. His words were spoken on purpose so long ago, knowing that I would need them now. His love is so far beyond my comprehension.

David said it quite perfectly in 2 Samuel 22, speaking of the enemies of God:

> Then I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth; I trod them like dirt in the streets and I scattered them.

This is what my Yahweh did to the lies that were wrapping around my heart. And now I can contemplate with purity in my heart, beauty in my imagination, and love in my body: "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

He is my Deliverer.
