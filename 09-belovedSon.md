# This is My beloved Son

Months ago when I gave my life to my Lord, I also gave Him my imagination. Since I was a child, it is a magical place to me and I've not used it wisely in recent years. So I told Him that it was His now. Anytime anything starts to play out in my imagination that is not of Him nor does it display the fruit of the Spirit, I immediately stop it: " My imagination belongs to Yahweh now."

One of my favorite ways to play in my imagination with Him is reading His words. Stories come to life when Holy Spirit is with me. All of His words are beyond beautiful to me, except for one story. Jesus asked me this week to face that story in myself.

Matthew 4:13-17

> Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him. But John tried to stop Him, saying, "I need to be baptized by You, and yet You come to me?" Jesus answered him, "Allow it for now, because this is the way for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed Him to be baptized.
>
> After Jesus was baptized, He went up immediately from the water. The heavens suddenly opened for Him and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming down on Him. And there came a voice from heaven saying:
>
> This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

## Childhood vision

When I was very young, perhaps four years old, I was sitting in the living room on the brown carpeting playing with some things. Suddenly, there was a man laying on the floor in front of me. He laid on his side with his head propped up by his hand. His body was chiseled and muscular, like a Michaelangelo statue. As I looked at him, I felt slightly uneasy but frozen in place.

Then a thundering voice from heaven said: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." As the voice said this, an unseen hand pulled down the cloth over the laying man's private area. All of his genitalia were revealed to me.

Then it all disappeared as my older brother walked into the room. He looked at me strangely and asked, "What are you doing?" I felt horribly guilty and said, "Nothing."

I didn't tell anyone about this, but every time those words are written or read, I feel that same gross uneasyness and violation. Around that same time, my grandfather had begun grooming me for later sexual assault.

## Jesus' Request This Week

I asked Him last night what verse He would like me to meditate on throughout my work week. I will write the verse at my desk and spend time each day memorizing and pondering it. Immediately He quoted verse 17 to me and said it was important that it no longer has this power over me.

I asked Him if He could show me His perspective on that event, His feelings about it, His need for those words from our Father. He said He would do that for me.

When I wrote down the verse today to start my work week, I knew I needed to tell this story. I believe that the enemy chose this verse for a specific reason that day. I also believe that he attacked my spiritual sight for a specific reason.

This was fresh in my mind due to a message by Kendra Barrows that I listened to last week during my workout. It was about identity and she used this story to describe how Jesus needed the Father to confirm who He was. This was His deepest identity.

But if that was His moment of finding His identity, what happened to me during that vision was a twisting and perverting of both my identity and Christ's. I believe Jesus is trying to reveal to me who He is, and then in turn, who I am. It is both of our identities within me that need restoration.  If I cannot know who He is in me, I will never know who I am in Him. 

So all the pieces are in place for this week. I will be free, I will know Him better, and I will be able to read these verses and find them beautiful. Knowing Him, there will be a part two to this entry.
