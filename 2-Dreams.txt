# Dreams
Instead of wondering where to begin, I will just write down a few beautiful dreams He has given me lately. There are so many, this is just a selection.

## Dec 6, the week I gave my life to Him.

The Most High lights a candle with me. He is in the form of a child.

I am in awe at the twinkling lights He made. The lights were really bright behind my closed sleeping eyelids. I am so honored that He wanted to do this with and for me. Afterwards, the shadow of a horse was on the ceiling above the bed. I gazed at it lovingly. I knew He left it for me.

When the Most High lights a candle for me, what does that mean? I felt like it was simply because He wanted to and found it beautiful.


## Jan 7

I was talking to Jesus and explained that I wasn't sure I would recognize the difference between His presence and a counterfeit. Would I? I wasn't sure. He assured me that I would know.

That night I had these two dreams, back to back.

**Dream 1**: I was on a mountaintop in a small shack and it was nighttime. A fire was lit in the fireplace. It was snowing hard outside. Then darkness came. Choking, heavy, suffocating. All I could do was pray in tongues. It was soo very hard to do, but I knew I had to keep praying. 

Behind me, an angel came up and he whispered into my ear new words that would help me keep this darkness at bay.

> Odudinn aloindinn elovandinn
> Odudinn aloindinn elovandinn

I spoke them twice. Water boils. 


**Dream 2**: I was staying with a woman, beautiful older woman (maybe in her 50's). Her hair was short, blonde, curls. Her eyes glowed bright vivid aquamarine blue -- unearthly blue and an unearthly glow. I've never seen any color like it. I was staying with her to learn.

Her life was practicing His presence. She spent each evening with Him, doing as He willed. I was getting ready for bed, doing my routine. She came in and said she'd like to spend more time with me tonight, but I can do my thing if I'd prefer that.

A part of me just wanted to go to bed, but I knew I was here to learn from her. So I grabbed my bible and met her at the dining room table. We sat across from each other. She asked, "Will we pray together?"

I felt the same nervousness of sharing prayer with someone, but I pushed that away. I will pray with her. Her aqua eyes were glowing like torches as she said, "Let's pray to prepare our minds for sleep. Are you able to invite Him in?" I nodded once.

As I looked at her I spoke, "Holy Spirit..." I paused as the room got heavy in anticipation and presence. "Come."

I caught a glimpse of her head and body flying back just as the same happened to me. A wall of living flame and wind threw us both against our chairs. My body was entirely incapacitated in the roar. I could feel the presence of God in a way I have never felt before. Oh, it was beautiful beyond description.

The wind was very warm, blowing my hair gently. The sound was of a raging furnace that filled my ears. My eyes didn't seem to work well, but what I saw was just undulating red of bright flames behind my eyelids. I wish I could clearly describe just how beautiful He is. All I could say was a slight whisper, "Holy Spirit you are so beautiful... so beautiful... so beautiful..."

When I woke, I was speaking these words aloud and continued to worship His beauty and grace and flame and wind and roar.

He was absolutely right. I recognize Him without *any* issue whatsoever. But there was more to those dreams than just the comparison. He was also telling me that I will feel both and walk in both, just in very different ways. I will walk in the dark mountaintops and He will give me the words and light to speak. I will call upon Him, and He will answer me with fire.

He also has given me angels to help me along these paths. The one behind me helping me with words in the darkness felt very much like my guardian angel, one who has been with me from the beginning of this life. The one with aquamarine eyes seemed to be in a womanly form for the dream's sake. I did not know what form she actually takes, but glimpses of her in my spiritual eyes showed a flowing. It feels (and felt then) to me like she is new in my life.

## Feb 21, Friends of God conference

That evening at the conference, I got so many words from God through people, but these two were back to back and matched the pair of dreams. The two women were people I had not previously met, they just walked up and began to prophecy over me.

Woman 1: I will bring light to dark places, places where others do not want to go. I will go into them and effortlessly 'throw open the curtains' to let in His light. The people that I will be drawn to are those that others dismiss or look over. God has given me His heart for them. I will look into the corners and see those that others would not see. I will gather them and present them to the King - train a new kind of army. I will see that they are washed and ready for battle.

I will go into these dark places with grace. A quiet grace that will do more for these people than a loudness every could. This grace He has given me for this purpose. He has equipped me and will provide all I need before I need it. He will protect me in those dark places and the darkness cannot touch me. It will be as the light. 

Woman 2: She saw a vivid blue-green color, a very bright aquamarine color. Something in the spiritual realm. It was like water, washing over me, moving around me. It prepares and cleanses me. "It glows so vividly!" (Yes, in my dream it was a startling glow of an unearthly color, definitely.)

I was stunned. So many prophecies that week reinforced and reflected my recent dreams, but this one was like a beautiful extra gemstone that God didn't have to include in my week. But He did and that was really beautiful.


## Feb 15, The Calling

I have felt for the past year that I am preparing to do whatever it is I am called to do on this earth. I did not know what that meant. This winter, that feeling only grew stronger. Holy Spirit previously told me in January that I should go to the Friends of God conference. I wasn't sure why - I hadn't ever been to anything like it before. I thought to myself, *Maybe I will get some insight into what I am called to do.*

I was talking to Father before sleep one night and asked Him to help me understand that calling. I fell asleep that night after visiting with God about my call. Here is what I dreamed.

YHWH Himself stood before me. He was three in one. I could see His face as my Father, then it would shift into Jesus Christ. Holy Spirit was a raging flame going up and down His legs and into me. I stood breathless and wordless before Him. The *bigness* of Him was indescribable. His voice was as a raging ocean and also so still and peaceful. I was so small in comparison. So very small. He said, "I have anointed you and I have called you. You ask what you have been called to do. I want you to be different than the others. Look to Me and obey Me. Follow My lead. I have called you. I have anointed you. Is that not enough?"

I awoke and immediately said, "Yes, my Lord and Master. That is enough."

### Feb 20, Friends of God conference

In the prophecy room on Thursday, before the conference began:

> Woman 1: Immediately when I looked at your feet, I felt the Lord telling me to bless your feet. Wherever He will carry you, to anoint your feet for the journey. (She then laid hands on my feet and blessed them.)

> Woman 2: When she was anointing your feet, I heard the Lord saying to you, "If I say 'Surely the darkness shall fall upon me,' even the night shall be as light about me; indeed the darkness shall not hide from You, but the night shines as the day. The darkness and the light are both alike to You." (Ps 139)

> Woman 1: I am really asking the Lord about you, Danielle. There is something very... mistique about what the Lord has for you or what He is calling you to do. You know part of what it is and I'm asking the Lord to show me what it is! There is just something very... positive. It has to do with your journey. I'd really like to know cause it's going to be so good! Tell me, Lord, I want to share!

> Woman 2: I see you walking on a path. The Lord said there are sharp edges where you are going. You are walking through those sharp edges and nothing is touching or coming near you. There are rocks all around you, but you are fully sheltered on the path. There is total refuge and stronghold around you in that place.

> Woman 1: Yes. And you feel safe in this path. Even with all this around you, you are walking barefoot and you know you won't be hurt. It won't touch you at all. You will continue to walk on the path God is leading you on. I wish I knew what it was!

Each of them said much more, but after they were all done I told them about the dream I had five days prior. They laughed and said, "No wonder He wasn't telling us!" 

In subsequent conversations with Him, He reminds of the verses in Phillipians 3:10-14:

> That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; if by any means I might attain to the resurrection from the dead.

> Not that I have already attained or am already perfected, but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me. Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended, but one thing I do: forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

He is my calling. And that is more than enough. Way more.

## Feb 28

I dreamed I was in a prophetic class.

Suddenly during the dream class, my eyes grew heavy and I knew I was actually sleeping in my bed. Holy Spirit invited me with Him. I said yes. I felt my spirit leave my body (a *shhick* feeling). As that happened, a large hand covered my eyes and ears. I could only see a flesh colored lightness, kind of like when your eyes are closed against a bright light and you can see the color of your eyelid. I could hear nothing.

We were immediately drawn into a place of such holiness, I know it must have been the throne of God Himself. I have never imagined nor felt holiness like this. It was entirely overwhelming, the pressure, warmth, and incredible beauty of Him. It pushed against me. I wasn't standing or sitting on anything, but I didn't feel as if I was hanging. I saw nothing, I heard nothing. It was just the feeling of His holiness and presence, which overwhelmed all senses.

In the midst of this intensity, all I could manage to think or say was "Holy..." As I said that, I pushed myself with all my strength towards the Father. Then He pushed back to me and I felt myself flying backwards. I'd then strain closer saying, "Holy..."

We continued this beautiful dance for some undefined length of time. It could have been many years or possibly only moments. Time was not there. Each time He pushed towards me, waves of pure holiness and power overwhelmed me. When I would push towards Him, it was an all-encompassing effort to strain closer through the holiness. It was beautiful, so perfect.

Eventually, Holy Spirit brought me back to my body and I felt my spirit slide back in (that same *shhick* feeling of things going back into place). I returned into the dream of the prophetic class.

When I awoke, I was in awe. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. At first, I was overwhelmed with thankfulness. What an incredible honor that He took me to my Father. What beauty... I have an understanding of holiness that I have never had before.

Then I realized something. The trust that I need to have for Him is beyond any level of trust I have ever *had* to have in Him. The bigness of the spirirtual world impressed itself upon me and I made a deal with Holy Spirit. I will trust Him, and I will never ever go anywhere without Him.

The weightiness of this trust has followed me ever since that night. And I continue to let Him know that next time, he could consider removing his hand from my ears and eyes.

This is where so many of my questions lie:
- Has this ever happened to you? That was an intense difference, and nothing like an open-eye vision, a screen-of-the-imagination vision, or a dream. This was not a dream, it was very very real.
- I never want to practice this by myself, but I want to practice with Him. At this time, I assume it is up to Him to initiate things like that. Is that the correct assumption? I am willing and I let Him know, but beyond that, I let Him decide?
- If you have had an out of body experience like this with Him, how did you manage that overwhelming feeling of complete trust? Or is that just me?
- For what reason does He do this? I am perfectly content with a reason being: He just wanted to dance with me like that. But perhaps there is something more, something I should learn or do about this. I am reminded of what Putty Putman said during the conference, that the prophetic gift is given to us, not for us.
- Will people believe me? I know that is a pretty minor thing. On one hand, it doesn't matter if they do. I know it was real and it was beautiful beyond description. On the other hand, I want to share it with someone and don't know who to share it with. Other than you two. :) Thank you for reading.

## March 21

I had met Holy Spirit in a dream and I had met my Father. I had yet to meet Jesus in His glory and I really wanted to. So I asked many times before going to sleep, "Can I see you tonight?"

This was my dream on this night. I was at my home and I walked outside onto the porch. I looked into the sky and the entire hemisphere was filled with raptors: eagles, hawks, ravens, and owls. Their wingspans were enormous. At first, it looked like it was chaos - just a writhing mass of them. As I looked in total awe, I noticed they were all flying in perfect synchronicity. This dance was perfect and flawless. If any one were to move incorrectly, it seemed there would be instant chaos with how quickly and closely they were flying. Swirls, swoops, dives, circles. I was in complete awe.

I finally ran inside to get Russ, I had to show him! I brought him outside and one of the eagles, the biggest, landed. His wingspan was about the width of my house. As He landed, He became half man, half owl. It was Jesus. He smiled at me and kissed me on the cheek. Then kissed Russ on the cheek.

That was the end of the dream. I thanked Him a lot a lot for that. It was beautiful and amazing.
