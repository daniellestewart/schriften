# The Rehearsal Dinner: A Dream

I was standing in the back of a church in the aisle watching a wedding rehersal. It was very close to the time of the wedding. The bride stood in the back, the groom not far from her. First, the bridesmaids went forward. They were late and completely disheveled, acting drunk. Their makeup was smeared and they were stumbling, slurring words, and being generally obnoxious. They mocked the bride and said mean things about her, laughing all the while.

Then the maid of honor went forward to give her speech. She was also disheveled and clearly not prepared for a wedding. Her speech was very insulting and was against the bride, continually putting the bride down and making herself out to be really special. She even made remarks about sex between herself and the groom.

As the bridesmaids and maid of honor spoke, I was growing more and more saddened and shocked by this mess. People in the congregation were kind of paying attention, but also talking amongst themselves. Those who were listening were gawking at the bride and whispering to each other, as if it was a game of telephone. I was in awe at the utter chaos and wondered how in the world anyone would be ready for a wedding or if would just be called off.

A very ancient and decrepit old man was standing at the podium overseeing all of this. I knew he was the father of the bride. His skin hung on his frame in grey blue tones. He didn't speak throughout any of it.

Throughout this, the bride and groom were standing next to each other towards the back of the church, quite near to where I was. They were watching with very sad eyes.

Finally, I saw the groom move. He walked down the aisle to the podium and stood directly behind the father of the bride. As he stepped up, the old man crumbled into a dead heap on the floor. The groom stood in silent sadness and said nothing, but a strength and resolve eminated from him.

Then I saw the bride. She was not yet ready for the wedding day, but she was so very beautiful. She stood tall with her back straight and her eyes locked on the groom. She also was sad, but carried herself with great dignity and respect. She slowly began to walk to the front. She was not yet wearing her wedding dress, but was put together. She walked to the front and her eyes did not waiver from the groom.

As soon as the bride began to walk forward, I saw her and I knew how incredibly important it was to pray for her. Immediately I prayed that angels would walk with her and protect her and that God would give her wisdom in what she did to handle this situation. The burden to pray was intense: protection and wisdom.

As the bride was making her way to the front, a woman stepped out from the congregation behind the bride and began to wave a very large and beautiful two-edged sword. The problem was that this woman was clearly untrained in sword fighting. She was trying to do fancy fencing moves, but she just looked like a baffoon. Furthermore, she was almost slicing into all the people around her. With one swoop, the sword whizzed by my face and I quickly backed up to miss the blow.

Then another woman from the congregation approached me. Her eyes seem to be begging for a word from God. I knew she was hungry for Him and wanted me to speak to her desperately. I loved her immediately and began to speak. But as I spoke, she began to lick my face. The licking was absolutely repulsive to me and I backed away very quickly, but I loved her. And I knew I needed to give her what she was looking for. I just did *not* want to be licked... so I held up my hand to block her and continued to speak the word God had given her through me.

Then I woke up.

## Some Background 
Over the last couple of months, I have been studying the bible for what it means to prepare myself and others to be the bride of Christ. It started when someone said, "He is preparing His bride," and I wasn't sure what that practically meant. This resulted in a very large study, one that is too involved for me to summarize here. This dream seemed to be a culminating lesson for me.

After waking and writing down the dream, I asked Holy Spirit to help me understand. I believe this dream is a representation of the state of the church and the body of Christ. Before I dive into what I believe each symbol of the dream represented, I want to make some things perfectly clear.

The bride, the followers of Christ who die to themselves and fix their eyes on Him, was beautiful in this dream. This bride consists of members of congregations, pastors, teachers, evangelists, prophets, and apostles. The bride also consists of people that may surprise us, that may not be in churches, have positions, or be known, but they love Jesus with their whole heart.

I also want to point out that any representation in this dream that is quite negative does not have to be. He wants to prepare *all* of us, even those that are now lost. Remember, He would leave the 99 to save the one. I do not want to condemn, but rather give a warning and a wakeup call to prepare ourselves and our fellow Christians. The love I had for all these people was amazing, and I believe that was the biggest takeaway of it all. His love and kindness is what leads to repentance and love is what will prepare the bride.

## The Interpretation
The wedding was not yet, but would be very soon. The rehearsal dinner is usually the time in which people are polishing the rough edges, but mostly ready to go. The rehearsal dinner is the last event before the big day. I believe that we are in those days in the earth right now. Whether the wedding will occur in my lifetime or not is entirely moot: what matters is that it is time to prepare, and our time is running out.

**Bridesmaids**:  Bridesmaids are close to the bride throughout wedding preparations and help usher her into the groom. They provide support, encouragement, and last minute detail coverage. I believe that the bridesmaids represented the shadow side of four of the five-fold ministry: prophets, evangelists, teachers, and apostles.

Remember what I said before! There are incredible men and women of God who are working to prepare the bride beautifully. This representation was the shadow side of these roles in the church. Instead of supporting her, leading the way to the groom at the front of the church, and building her up before the wedding day, they were late, disheveled, unkempt, and bitter.
- Late: The foolish virgins (Matt 25:1-13).
- Unkempt makeup, hair, and dresses: They were not wearing robes of righteousness, but were drunk in their positions. By focusing on the position they held, they were absorbed with themselves and their own ambitions. Their words were used to prop themselves up and put down those around them. Those who are focused on selfish ambition and their position will see the true bride and put her down.

**Maid of honor**: The maid of honor is the closest one to the bride and does the most to prepare her for the wedding day. They are there to dry her tears, make sure her dress is in order, and address any concerns. They do the running around so that the bride can be at peace before the final hour. I believe this represented the shadow pastors that are not preparing their congregations, but are instead focused on money, power over people, and their status.

Pastors are supposed to be the heart of the Shepherd toward His bride. They provide support, love, and teaching that brings the rest of us into alignment with His heart. They should consistently be pointing us to Jesus in all they do.
- Arrogance: Putting themselves above their congregations, finding themselves of more worth, or closer to God because of their position.
- Insulting the integrity of the groom: Claiming to be the mouthpiece of God for their congregation, but speaking lies and gossip about true men and women of God.
- Insulting the bride's position to her groom: Claiming that those whom God loves are rejected by God and are less than what they themselves are.

**The father of the bride**: The patriarchy is a covering structure that provides stability to culture and groups of people. I think the father of the bride is the organizational structure of religion and churches. When Christ stands up, the organization crumbles and dies.

**The Groom**: None other than Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. He patiently watched all this going on and was so incredibly sad, yet resolute. He knows that through the chaos, His bride will be ready for the wedding day. However, He also knows that there will be those who said, "Lord, look at all we did in Your name!" and He will have to send them away. He was steady, slow, and calm. He was peace, despite the pain. And the way He looked at His bride was unforgettable.

**The bride**: She represented those who are preparing themselves for Him. This includes all those in ministerial positions, those who are members of congregations, and those who are neither, but love Him with all they are. She was so beautiful, regal, and loving. But she was noticeably set apart from the rest of the people. They noticed, as did anyone else who would look at the situation. Although she was treated poorly by the others there, she loved them nonetheless.

When she was moving to the front, I knew that what would happen would be critical. I did not know how she would address the chaos, I did not know how it would all play out, but I knew something big was about to happen. Her protection and wisdom was of utmost importance. And whatever happened would be the grand conclusion to the rehearsal dinner.

**The woman with the sword**: I believe she represented those who think they are warriors for Christ, but instead attack His people. They do not weild the mighty words of God with grace, but instead try to clobber others with it. She clearly thought she was well-trained and moving with Holy Spirit. Her facial expression was one of great sincerity. But she was incredibly dangerous to everyone, including herself.

His word should never be used to gain a position, weild authority over, or to maneuver other people where you want them. It is not for your own gain. It is a revelation of who He is to us. Treat it with the respect that He deserves.

**The licking woman**: I believe she represented those who hear the word of the Lord coming from someone in ministry and try to raise them up beyond what they should be. They treat them with an attitude of worship and adoration instead of looking to Christ. When Holy Spirit told me what this meant, I was relieved that my deepest feeling in that dream was repulsion and I pray it will remain that way anytime anyone looks to me instead of Him.

However, I truly loved her. I needed to block that action, but I also wanted to continue the minstry. I can imagine in real life, this would be incredibly difficult to do. Having not been in a ministry position I can only speculate that balance would be so very important. As would listening to the voice of God... for I am sure there are times when it becomes necessary to push a person like that far away. This is another element of the dream that I will revisit in later years to gain new perspectives. 

## The main takeaway

There are so many takeaways to this dream. It is a big dream and I feel it is really important right now. There are nonetheless two main points that I felt were highlighted to me.

 - (1) Pray for protection and wisdom for the bride. We need these now and we need to walk in them consistently. What we do now will change everything in the upcoming wedding preparations.

 - (2) Love. His love is what prepares the bride and His kindness brings people to repentance (Rom 2:4). There is no other way.
