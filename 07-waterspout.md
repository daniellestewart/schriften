# 7 The River and the Waterspout

Holy Spirit asked me to follow Him and I followed. (This vision was another that played out on the screen of my imagination.) He took me to a tall rock that overlooked a massive desert. The desert was dry, but had small signs of life. A cactus, some sagebrush, a little critter running under a rock. The landscape reminded me of the desert rock in western states - stacked boulders and seemingly precarious red rock formations. 

As I looked around, I wondered why I was seeing this. He told me to keep watching. After many minutes, I noticed a very tiny stream meandering through the land. Then a small waterspout formed over the water. It didn't look very significant, just little and whirling. It pulled water into itself and then moved out onto the land as a tornado. Water sprayed out from it and mixed with the dust. Then the tornado moved back to the stream and repeated the process.

Each time it pulled water from the stream, the stream grew stronger, faster, and wider. The waterspout also grew, albeit much slower than the stream, which very soon became a raging river.

"What is it?" I asked.

"You and Me," He responded.

When He said that, a great understanding came into my mind and heart. 

## 7.1 The Desert
The world around me is barren of life without Christ, but even in the driest places, He is there.

Isaiah 43:19
> See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up, do you not perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.

Isaiah 58:11
> Yahweh will always lead you, satisfy you in a parched land, and strengthen your bones. You will be like a watered garden and like a spring whose water never runs dry.

Where I go in my life is like this desert. If I look carefully, I will see Him in people, places, and circumstances, even when it is so small and seemingly insignificant. The sagebrush and cactus represented people or situations that on outward appearances do not seem to carry much life. Perhaps people who are not followers of Christ, yet have messages from Him for me. Perhaps situations that seem very dark, yet will bring me to new revelations of His power. It was very clear to me that these forms of His life are not to be disregarded because they aren't traditionally acceptable ways of hearing His voice.

## 7.2 The Stream
He is the living water and He is the stream in the dry places. He is water, He is life.

John 4:13-14
> Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.

John 7:37-38
> If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water. 

Wherever I go, as long as I follow Him, I follow that stream. At times, it may seem like a trickle, but we know what He can do with a desert. It was also important that I never drift from the stream. The movement of the water and the wind funnel was together - they were not separate, but they were distinct. Streams and rivers move, just as the Spirit moves. He does not grow stagnant, therefore I must move with Him, else I will.

The stream also grew as it was being pulled up and released out. As I drank the water and released it into the world around me, the stream became a river. It seemed as if it would not have grown had the waterspout not been there to draw more and more water. This seems to represent  my capacity to manage what Holy Spirit provides. If I keep it to myself and only stay on the stream, I don't think His work in me would grow as large. It was matching my movement to His and releasing His life to the world around me that was the catalyst for growth of His work in me and in the world around me.

## 7.3 The Waterspout 
At first, the waterspout was so small that it seemed silly to think that such a thing could water the desert. But that waterspout was faithfully drinking in water and then releasing it out, and as it was faithful with the little bit it could handle, it grew to handle wayyy more.

This reminds me of the parable of the talents in Matthew 25:14-30, especially verse 21:

> His lord said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord."

The tornado never strayed far from the stream when it went onto land. In fact, it remained very close to the stream. This meant that I needed to always know where Jesus wanted to move and stay with Him. I should not veer away Him to release water, but always stay close. As He moved (the stream turned and meandered), I moved (the tornado went along with it).

With time, it became a raging tornado that dumped thousands of gallons of water on the surrounding land. And the river, oh, that river... It was the kind of river that you see and know how it is that a river formed the Grand Canyon. The kind of river that will strip away anything in its way and transform the land into a valley of beauty and life.

Isaiah 35:1-10
> The wilderness and the dry land will be glad; the desert will rejoice and blossom like a wildflower. It will blossom abundantly and will also rejoice with joy and singing.
>
> The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the Lord, the splendor of our God. Strengthen the weak hands, steady the shaking knees!
>
> Say to the cowardly:
>
> “Be strong; do not fear! Here is your God; vengeance is coming. God’s retribution is coming; he will save you.” Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped.
>
> Then the lame will leap like a deer, and the tongue of the mute will sing for joy, for water will gush in the wilderness, and streams in the desert; the parched ground will become a pool, and the thirsty land, springs. In the haunt of jackals, in their lairs, there will be grass, reeds, and papyrus.
>
> A road will be there and a way; it will be called the Holy Way. The unclean will not travel on it, but it will be for the one who walks the path. Fools will not wander on it. There will be no lion there, and no vicious beast will go up on it; they will not be found there.
>
> But the redeemed will walk on it, and the ransomed of the Lord will return and come to Zion with singing, crowned with unending joy. Joy and gladness will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee.
