# 3. Learning to Pray

When I told Yahweh that I would give Him all of me, I really meant
it. I had already seen what my life would be like without Him, and it
was so pale in comparison. I didn't mind what others thought, I was
willing to give up everything. I wanted to love Him like I did when I
was little.

So I did and still am to the best of my ability. Over the last few
months, I am starting to see what He meant when He said:

>Truly I say unto you, unless you change and
>become as little children, you can by no means enter the kingdom of
>heaven. Matt 18:3

Whatever He says, I accept as truth, even the things I don't
understand. I ask sooo many questions, and He answers them. If I am
not sure that I heard Him, He is so patient to confirm His word. If
I read about something in the bible that I want to experience in Him,
I trust that He will show me, take me, teach me. I listen and try so
very hard to obey because I love Him so much. The more I love Him, the
more I want to obey. I'm still practicing all of this and have a
*very* long ways to go, but I suspect this attitude is really important.

Since December of 2024, His word has come alive to me - it is my
beauty and strength. He speaks to me so often and knows me well enough
to say, "Would you like me to pause so you can write this down?"
Almost every night He gives me dreams. Every day I spend time talking
to Him. 

## 3.1 Praying

When I was a child and adults prayed, it was usually *really*
dull. They would say a bunch of stuff in really emotionally serious
voices and it was droning. Often it sounded a lot like complaining
to me. It was way different when I was talking with Jesus. I liked our
way better.

When I was young, around 3 or 4, my parents were taking us
to a church. The building was at one time a
saloon in a very small logging town in northern Minnesota. The floors
were cracked tile, the walls dingy and dank, and there were hardly any
windows. The old pews were so very uncomfortable. The tile floor was
so loud and echoey, every time I walked it *click-clacked* and I
couldn't be quiet. I disliked it there.

I knew when I died, I'd go to heaven, so one day I was imagining what
heaven would be like. *Well, God is in church and God is in heaven. We
worship at church and we will worship in heaven. Oh no...* My heart
fell as I imagined a shadowy dank place where I would sit in a pew for
all of eternity. I complained and said to Jesus that I wanted my
heaven to be different than the ones the grown ups go to. He assured
me that it would be much different than that. After that conversation,
I quite liked imagining heaven with Jesus.

When I gave Him my life in early December, I asked Him quite
seriously, "How do I pray?" I knew the Lord's prayer, but even that
had seemed to be rote and ritualistic. He asked me to break apart the
Lord's prayer, bit by bit. He taught me things about each of the lines,
but then when we got to: "Your will be done on earth as it is in
heaven," I asked the inevitable question, "How do I know Your will in
situations?" I knew to search the bible, but beyond that I wasn't
sure. The next morning, Holy Spirit showed me how to do something I've
never done before.

Each morning since then, I wake early and go upstairs with my tea. I
sit in the dark and wait for Holy Spirit. He is always ready. He takes
me on His wings and shows me things on the screen of my
imagination. First I begin where I live and my surrounding area. This
expands to the state, the nation, the world.

This is very hard to explain.

I see the earth beneath us, but it has layers. Some individuals and
homes are beams of light; they carry the life of Jesus Christ. Some I
see praying, others sleep, others carry on with a
routine. Sometimes the people are doing things that represent
something I should pray about. Some places have storms overhead (I
call them storms because I don't know what else to call unsettled
darkness in the spiritual world). Holy Spirit takes me where he'd like
to go and has me look and see. In my body, I am muttering in
our languages, other times He asks me for silence. When I look, I see
aspects of truths beyond physical life.

Here is an example of a man that Holy Spirit took me to see early
on. (He has taken me to him almost every day, so I may be getting some
details mixed between times, but that is okay I think.)

Holy Spirit took me to his home and we sat outside at the edge of the
yard. First, I saw the foundation of his home. A large gap was missing
and dark slimy looking stream was leaking out of the gap. A storm was
overhead, churning -- really unsettling. When I looked at the
individual, I could see a very deep wound in his chest that had been
propped open with sticks. A demonic being was prodding it. The
man's eyes were cold and icy looking.

My first thoughts were: "Woah, I have to do something! What do I
say?" He patiently said for me to wait. To look and understand before
I speak. "Don't jump in without knowing what you are up against." So I
asked Him what these things meant.

In this individual's case, he had old wounds that shook the
foundations of his identity, his faith, and his very being (the gap in
the foundation). He also had a more recent wound that the enemy kept
playing across his mind and heart (chest). Bitterness had set up shop
years ago (eyes) and chaos (the storm) was flooding his thoughts.

After Holy Spirit told me all this -- not in words, but as I looked
quietly, I knew what each thing was -- I asked, "What is Your will for
him?" Immediately, Holy Spirit got very excited and the words welled
up in me effortlessly.

I looked at the foundation, "God's word is a lamp unto your feet and a
light unto your path." I could see the foundation gap begin to
close. I knew that the wound needed to get washed out, so I spoke
living water over and through it, cleansing and healing the wound. As
I spoke out loud, muttering under my breath, I could see beautiful
living water rush into the gaping wound, knocking free the sticks that
propped it open. I spoke peace over him, that the peace that passes
all understanding rule and reign in his life, mind, and heart. As I
did, a soft light cloud came in on a gentle breeze and completely
disintegrated the chaos above his home.

"Okay, lets go." Holy Spirit said. And we were off to the next place.

Sometimes Holy Spirit takes me to individuals, sometimes those I know
or those I have not yet met. More often, my time each morning is spent
looking at groups of people, states, nations, etc. I *love* when He
takes me to see individuals, though. It is special to me, because He
told me one day I will meet many of these people. And I love
them. Every one that I see, I love so very much. But so often, He has
me look, see, and speak over many people at once.

And the more I see, the more convinced I am that the whole earth truly
is filled with His glory. I don't know why I know this. So much of
what He shows me is the enemy's turf. So many people are lost and I
truly love them -- I feel a tiny tiny fraction of Father's heart
towards them. But He also shows me all those beautiful beams of light
rising from homes. He shows me the power of that man in India praying
every single day. He shows me the child that dreams of Him and sees
angels. The mother that chose to keep her child, despite her deep
fears. And much more.

My mornings are intense sometimes and I love them. The time stretches
longer and longer the more I look and see. I will have to start
getting up even earlier now.

## 3.2 A Morning Lesson of Particular Importance

On February 26 after my prayer time, I wrote this down so I would not
forget.

During morning time with Holy Spirit, I saw an area in my range as we
were flying overhead. I asked Holy Spirit what He wanted me to speak
over it. It was dark and churning. He said, "Nothing." I was
confused. "...Then why did you show it to me?"

  "Because you are looking, you see it. We fly above so that you can
  see, but not all that you see should you focus on right now."

  "But don't you want to put that situation into the light?" I asked.

  "Yes, but just as in battle, we have to plan our movement. It isn't
  always the right time. If we attack everything at once, we become
  divided in our attention and may not have the focus and energy to
  really push forward. You fly with Me, so simply ask. I will let you
  know what to say and when to stay silent in flight."

We continued to fly in complete silence. After a few moments, I began
to mutter in our language again. He shushed me. I could then see light
sparking and flying from us as I spoke. Then when I said nothing, just
dark complete silence. Interesting.

## 3.3 Learning His Heart

Occasionally when I am sitting on Father's lap, He will ask me ever so
gently, "Is there anything you want to ask of Me?" My heart beats
quickly when He asks me this, I truly love it. But every single time,
one and only one thing is important enough for me to ask. "Can I
please have Your heart? Mine isn't enough..." Even just writing this
out, my heart aches to have His heart.

As I pray every morning, I am learning more and more what it means
to say, "Your will be done." Sometimes it is hard. I see situations
and have opinions. But I have been told not to speak unless He speaks
through me.

One day, He brought me to a home in midwest US. I do not know if this
was happening at the same time I was praying, if we time shifted, or
if it was a representation of what had been happening or would happen
in the future. I didn't ask, it seemed not to matter. I just know that
it was real and these people are real and what I did with Holy Spirit
changed things. A woman was in the process of being beat by her
husband. I could see it all and it was brutal. Holy Spirit and I
landed between them and I held up my hand. The man froze mid swing
still in a rage. The woman was bloody on the floor.

Again, He told me, "Look before you speak." As I looked at the man, at
first I saw an angry, ugly man with blood on his fist. But as I looked
closer, I could see the chains around him and the twisted nature of
his heart that was once so kind. When we first arrived, my heart went
out to the woman. But as I looked, I could feel that Yahweh's heart
was focused on loving this man. He was given a very sensitive heart
and it was broken so many times when he was a child. He was called to
be a protector, a warrior of justice, and a man of kindness.

The words I spoke were not words that Danielle would speak. They were
Jesus' words of reminding this man who he was, who he could be, and who God
would make him into. Light poured into him in those moments. He wept
on the floor and Jesus held him.

It wasn't until then that He turned my attention back onto the woman
to help heal her as well.

That was not my heart. Not at all. I desperately need His heart to
completely replace my own.
