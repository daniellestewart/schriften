# David and the Chariots: A Dream


David was running with all his might. Leaping over stones, darting around obstacles. He ran and the Spirit carried him. The land was dry and full of crevices and boulders. The young mans curly red hair was barely wet with sweat despite the incredible distance he was running. I could almost hear a song in him as he ran and I watched from behind him. He was beyond joyful, he was worshipping with every step, just not aloud. 

I watched him cover many miles of ground and eventually approach a great old city. The walls of the city were high and a few soldiers stood guard atop the wall. The gates were closed. At the city gate, a guard and friend saw him running from a distance and ran out to meet him. They embraced. David was exuberant and joy was palpable around him. He said to the guard, "The city is surrounded by dark spirits in chariots. We are under attack."

The guard looked startled, "This isn't our strong suit. We cannot win against them..." The guard was an aged soldier with lines around his eyes. Such kindness and strength was in him, but it was obvious that he was a mighty man of war and valor. His worry was not due to unseasoning or cowardice, but rather a gut knowing that comes with many years of practice. 

David laughed and took the man by the shoulders, looking directly into his eyes, "If Yahweh is for us, *who can be against us?!*" 

I then looked around the city and saw the mighty dark army that was approaching. Every hill around was covered with troops, chariots, darkness, and ash. The army was made of very dark spirits, many of which were impressive to behold. They made loud noises, slamming their boots and spears into the ground, clanging their shields together, and shrieking in anticipation.

And I suddenly understood David's joy. Yahweh will show Himself very powerful, indeed! An understanding and revelation came upon me, the same understanding that overwhelemed David. In the places we are weak, that is where He is strong. Yahweh waits for opportunities to show His power.

"This is *perfect*," I thought to myself. The total brilliance of God's hand was astonishing. Not only would hoards of enemies be in utter ruin, but the people of Yahweh will see His hand and the people of other gods will see that He is the Most High. There is none like Him. 

As a son of the Most High, David saw forces of darkness assembling and became ecstatic and joyful at what his beautiful God will do. David was not running to warn the city; he was running so that he could share this incredible joy with his friend. And he ran so that he would have front row seats to what Yahweh would do for them.

## Pondering About the Dream

Immediately upon wakng, such joy filled me. I was excited all day to see what my Lord will do. And many thoughts came about this dream throughout the day. There are multiple stories in the old testament that came to mind.

The Spirit of God coming over David to perform incredible bodily feats in 2 Sam 22:30, 35:

> For by You, I can attack a barrier; by my God I can leap over a wall.

> He trains my hands for war; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.

And likewise with Elijah outrunning a chariot in 1 Kings 18:44-46:

> Then Elijah said, “Go and tell Ahab, ‘Get your chariot ready and go down so the rain doesn’t stop you.’”
> In a little while, the sky grew dark with clouds and wind, and there was a downpour. So Ahab got in his chariot and went to Jezreel. The power of the Lord was on Elijah, and he tucked his mantle under his belt and ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

The story also reminded me of when the Arameans surrounded the city where Elisha and his servant were staying, 2 Kings 6:15-17:

> When the servant of the man of God got up early and went out, he discovered an army with horses and chariots surrounding the city. So he asked Elisha, “Oh, my master, what are we to do?”
>
> Elisha said, “Don’t be afraid, for those who are with us outnumber those who are with them.”
>
> Then Elisha prayed, “Lord, please open his eyes and let him see.” So the Lord opened the servant’s eyes. He looked and saw that the mountain was covered with horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.

After this dream, I fully believe that when that servants eyes were opened, it was not just in seeing the Lord's army, but also the joy of what God would do in that seemingly hopeless situation. When the enemy surrounds us, it is our natural and fleshly instinctual urge to fear. But what does the Spirit of God have to say about that?

2 Sam 22:31:

> God — His way is perfect;
> the word of the Lord is pure.
> He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.

Proverbs 18:10:

> The name of Yahweh is a strong tower;
> the righteous run to it and are protected.

The word of God is full of descriptions of Yahweh as our refuge, defense, and protection. He fights for us. He is the Lord of Hosts.

Isaiah 59:18:

> They will fear the name of Yahweh in the west
> and His glory in the east;
> for He will come like a rushing stream
> driven by the wind of the Lord.

I love this! Imagine being surrounded with whatever it is you are up against right now. Imagine the darkness, the difficulties, the seemingly insurmountable emeny that has chosen you as its target. By yourself, you can do nothing against it (John 15:5). But then, on the horizon you begin to see a small cloud form. This tiny cloud moves toward you and as it nears, it gets larger and *faster*. You finally see that the wind in the cloud carries with it a rushing stream of living water. This raging torrent roars around you. Nothing can withstand the power of this living water. No enemy can stand, no word or weapon against you will succeed.

Isaiah 54:17:

> No weapon formed against you will succeed,
> and you will refute any accusation raised against you in court.
> This is the heritage of the Lord’s servants, and their righteousness is from Me.”
> This is the Lord’s declaration.

Psalm 121:

> I lift my eyes toward the mountains.
> Where will my help come from?
> My help comes from the Lord,
> the Maker of heaven and earth.
>
> He will not allow your foot to slip;
> your Protector will not slumber.
> Indeed, the Protector of Israel
> does not slumber or sleep.
>
> The Lord protects you;
> the Lord is a shelter right by your side.
>
> The sun will not strike you by day or the moon by night.
>
> The Lord will protect you from all harm;
> He will protect your life.
>
> The Lord will protect your coming and going both now and forever.

I am also reminded of the time that David and his mighty men returned to Ziklag, where their wives and children lived (1 Sam 30). While they were gone, the Amalekites had invaded and burned the city, and took their wives and children captive. Understandably, the men were all beside themselves with grief, which quickly turned to great anger towards David. They wanted to stone him to death.

The verses in this story are terse, but just imagine what that would be like. You have trained 600 men to be absolute warriors, some of the best the world has ever seen. And they decide to kill you. Your wife is gone, as are your children. Your city has burned despite your great prowess in war. You are entirely surrounded.

What David did is incredible and I believe a major lesson for us:

> But David strengthened himself in the Lord his God. (vs 6)

Before inquiring of God, before begging for His help, before asking why, before running from the threat of death, David strengthened himself in the Lord. I do not know exactly how he did this, but I certainly know what it feels like to be strengthened in my Lord. Then and only then did David inquire of the Lord for his next steps (vs 7-8).

It is easy to live by our physical eyes and see the enemy surrounding on all sides. And very easy for us to ask things like: who failed? Did I do something wrong? Did someone else fall into sin and cause this? What do I do now?

Perhaps asking questions first is not the right thing to do when surrounded. Perhaps the right thing to do is to strengthen ourselves in the Lord. Once we have His strength, then we will know what question to ask and we will know how to hear what the answer is. Just as David knew what to ask and how to listen:

> So David inquired of the Lord, "Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I overtake them?" And He answered, "Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all."

The story is not clear how David convinced the men who wanted to kill him to follow again into battle, but I can imagine a very Braveheart-like scene and it makes me smile. They did, indeed, overtake the Amalekites and all that was taken was recovered. 

And I cannot find any better way to wrap up the discussion than to remind you of Ephesians 6:10-18:

> Finally, be strengthened by the Lord and by His vast strength. Put on the full armor of God so that you can stand against the tactics of the Devil. For our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world powers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavens. This is why you must take up the full armor of God, so that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having prepared everything, to take your stand. Stand, therefore,
>
> with truth like a belt around your waist,
> righteousness like armor on your chest, 
> and your feet sandaled with readiness for the gospel of peace.
> In every situation take the shield of faith,
> and with it you will be able to extinguish
> all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 
> Take the helmet of salvation,
> and the sword of the Spirit,
> which is God’s word.
>
> Pray at all times in the Spirit with every prayer and request, and stay alert in this with all perseverance and intercession for all the saints.
