The same week of reading and contemplating worshipping the Father in spirit and in truth, I was contemplating the entire passage in which that verse occurs.

John 4:1-26

> [Jesus] came to a town of Samaria called Sychar near the property that Jacob had given his son Joseph. Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, worn out from His journey, sat down at the well. It was about six in the evening.
>
> A woman of Samaria came to draw water.
>
> “Give Me a drink,” Jesus said to her, 8 for His disciples had gone into town to buy food.
>
> “How is it that You, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” she asked Him. For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.
>
> Jesus answered, “If you knew the gift of God, and who is saying to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would ask Him, and He would give you living water.”
>
> “Sir,” said the woman, “You don’t even have a bucket, and the well is deep. So where do You get this ‘living water’? You aren’t greater than our father Jacob, are You? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and livestock.”
>
> Jesus said, “Everyone who drinks from this water will get thirsty again. 14 But whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty again—ever! In fact, the water I will give him will become a well of water springing up within him for eternal life.”
>
> “Sir,” the woman said to Him, “give me this water so I won’t get thirsty and come here to draw water.”
>
> “Go call your husband,” He told her, “and come back here.”
>
> “I don’t have a husband,” she answered.
>
> “You have correctly said, ‘I don’t have a husband,’” Jesus said. “For you’ve had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.”
>
> “Sir,” the woman replied, “I see that You are a prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, yet you Jews say that the place to worship is in Jerusalem.”
>
> Jesus told her, “Believe Me, woman, an hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.  You Samaritans worship what you do not know. We worship what we do know, because salvation is from the Jews. But an hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth. Yes, the Father wants such people to worship Him. God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”
>
> The woman said to Him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (who is called Christ). “When He comes, He will explain everything to us.”
>
> “I am He,” Jesus told her, “the One speaking to you.”

As I read, I wondered about the relations between Jews and Samaritans. My bible has footnotes, so I looked and it said:

> John inserts an explanatory note about the hostility between Jews and Samaritans, who were a mixed race, the result of Assyrians intermarrying with Jews who had stayed behind in the norther territory following Isreal's demise (see 2 Kin. 17:24-41).

Naturally, I followed this lead.

2 Kings 17:24-41

> Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in place of the Israelites in the cities of Samaria. The settlers took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities. When they first lived there, they did not fear Yahweh. So the Lord sent lions among them, which killed some of them. The settlers spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations that you have deported and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the requirements of the God of the land. Therefore He has sent lions among them that are killing them because the people don’t know the requirements of the God of the land.”
> 
>  Then the king of Assyria issued a command: “Send back one of the priests you deported. Have him go and live there so he can teach them the requirements of the God of the land.” So one of the priests they had deported came and lived in Bethel, and he began to teach them how they should fear Yahweh.
>
> But the people of each nation were still making their own gods in the cities where they lived and putting them in the shrines of the high places that the people of Samaria had made. The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of the Sepharvaim. They feared the Lord, but they also appointed from their number priests to serve them in the shrines of the high places. They feared the Lord, but they also worshiped their own gods according to the custom of the nations where they had been deported from.
>
> To this day they continue practicing the former rituals...

This fascinated me - there is so much in this short set of verses. The mixing of allegiance reminded me of worshipping in spirit and in truth: having a heart that is single towards the Father. I also began wondering about these gods that they worshipped. I could not help but think of Michael Heiser's teachings and wondered about them. 

After reading this and pondering for a while, I was ready for sleep. That night before I went to sleep, I asked Father if I would dream of Him tonight. He responded, "No, but I will be with you."

That was good enough for me. I fell asleep.
