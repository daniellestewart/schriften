The same week of reading about worshipping the Father in spirit and in truth, I was contemplating the passage in which that verse occurs.

Excerpts from John 4:1-26

> ...Jesus, worn out from His journey, sat down at the well...
>
> A woman of Samaria came to draw water.
>
> “Give Me a drink,” Jesus said to her...
>
> “How is it that You, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” she asked Him. For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.
>
> Jesus answered, “If you knew the gift of God, and who is saying to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would ask Him, and He would give you living water.”
>
> “Sir,” said the woman, “You don’t even have a bucket, and the well is deep. So where do You get this ‘living water’?...”
>
> Jesus said, “Everyone who drinks from this water will get thirsty again. But whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty again—ever! In fact, the water I will give him will become a well of water springing up within him for eternal life.”

As I read, I wondered about the relations between Jews and Samaritans. My bible has footnotes, so I looked and it said:

> John inserts an explanatory note about the hostility between Jews and Samaritans, who were a mixed race, the result of Assyrians intermarrying with Jews who had stayed behind in the norther territory following Isreal's demise (see 2 Kin. 17:24-41).

Naturally, I followed this lead.

2 Kings 17:24-41

> Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in place of the Israelites in the cities of Samaria. The settlers took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities. When they first lived there, they did not fear Yahweh. So the Lord sent lions among them, which killed some of them. The settlers spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations that you have deported and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the requirements of the God of the land. Therefore He has sent lions among them that are killing them because the people don’t know the requirements of the God of the land.”
> 
>  Then the king of Assyria issued a command: “Send back one of the priests you deported. Have him go and live there so he can teach them the requirements of the God of the land.” So one of the priests they had deported came and lived in Bethel, and he began to teach them how they should fear Yahweh.
>
> But the people of each nation were still making their own gods in the cities where they lived and putting them in the shrines of the high places that the people of Samaria had made. The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of the Sepharvaim. They feared the Lord, but they also appointed from their number priests to serve them in the shrines of the high places. They feared the Lord, but they also worshiped their own gods according to the custom of the nations where they had been deported from.
>
> To this day they continue practicing the former rituals...

This fascinated me - there is so much in this short set of verses. The mixing of allegiance reminded me of worshipping in spirit and in truth: having a heart that is single towards the Father. I also began wondering about these gods that they worshipped. I could not help but think of Michael Heiser's teachings and wondered about them. Who were they before they fell? Who did they become after they fell? Are any still worshipped?

Evenutally, I was ready for sleep. That night before I went to sleep, I asked Father if I would dream of Him tonight. He responded, "No, but I will be with you."

That was good enough for me. I fell asleep.

## Dream, March 15

I was in a dark place. There was no light there. Something bolted me to the ground - not a physical thing, but energetic binding. I could not leave, and I knew I was there by my own choices. I could not leave until the god was served. I had crawled into his territory in the deep, and I knew the penalty. I waited for my time. He chose me and soon will want me. I laid in his bed.

A tall throne was above me. A throne of a god. All grey, sharp, and cold. When he came to me, he crawled. He spoke in a slimy, sickening voice that crawled inside of my ears, "Others try to run. They scream and cry out. Will you too?"

I didn't say anything in return, but I determined in myself not to scream. Then he knelt in front of me and put the fingers of my hands into his mouth. His teeth ground into the middle phalanx of all eight fingers. I could hear grinding and popping. But far worse than the sound was the feeling of my blood and energy flowing out from my fingers into him.

Slowly, it drained. The flow of energy out of me like that was incredibly painful. I felt dirty, used, violated. I was being raped in a whole new way. I tried to grit my teeth, and I tried so very hard not to scream.

I looked up for anyone who could help me. In the darkness close by, I saw John, the writer of the gospel and the man who had revelations. He was wearing a silver-grey suit and his hair was all slicked back. He wasn't looking at me - he was talking pleasantly to someone who was not there.

I have to call to John! He knows where the unfindable ones are! I could not hold back any longer, "John, please see me! Please find me..." I screamed in pain, but John could not hear or see me. *No man can hear or see into this place*, I thought to myself. The god continued to suck and crunch my fingers. So much pain. But this is the price and it must be paid.

## The Interpretation

When I awoke, it took me a while to gather my bearings. Immediately, I knew that a spiritual being had been revealed to me. It was so real and unlike many other dreams I have. In the dream, I did not know to call to Jesus. It was as if I did not belong to him, I belonged to this other god.

I also considered that when I feel Holy Spirit wanting to move through me, it is my hands that direct the flow. I wondered if hands are a "spigot" for energy within us. For that being to suck and crunch them was to open the gate and turn on the flow. After pondering, I decided I would just go right to the Source of that dream Himself. I began to ask questions and write down the answers.

"So, what is this being?" I asked Him.

> It is one of the Assyrian gods that you read about last night.

"Is he still worshipped?"

> Yes.

"Does he do that to his... worshippers?"

> Yes.

"Why did you give me that dream?"

> Because I need you to understand the enemy and his plans. In this case, he has been mostly moving out of convenience and opportunity. A great opportunity has arisen and his territory will be able to spread. Another unholy alliance. As it spreads, you will run into him and need to understand who he is and what he seeks.

"Why are there unholy alliances now? Is that new?"

> There have been alliances since the falls, but lately many more - and of much more consequence. They know their time is short. My people are waking up to the reality of the spirit world and who they really are in Me and I in them. Michael Heiser did the enemy no favors. Now the enemy moves quickly to quell the movement of light and freedom.

"What should I do today?"

> First, consider the elements of the god and why this is what he seeks and feeds on. I will guide you. Then consider how he could move in your culture. He aims for the United States. He hasn't tasted people here. Consider also what his original design was. That will tell you much about his direction now.

"To destroy his original design that he sees reflected in others?"

> Yes! That is always what they seek. It breaks my heart to see my beautiful creation fall to this.

## Praying That Morning

I began to pray in a really unique language. I hadn't tasted that one before. Then this began to play out in my mind's eye, very clearly and not from my own making.

I saw a man. He was in the states and came from elsewhere (Syria, perhaps?). He worshipped this being. I saw flashes of his childhood: alone, afraid, given to this creature. Tried to scream, but no one could hear.

I felt the love of Jesus well up in me. That is such a light way to say that... It welled up so much that I could barely speak. Tears dripped down my chin and this language continued in a groaning, barely able to speak kind of way. *Intense* love wove around every single word.

I saw His hands begin to move, but His hands weren't outside of me. It was as if I was inside of Him and my hands were inside of His. He began to work on this man, pulling and weaving. There were pieces of the man's soul in other places that Jesus grabbed and wove into him again. Brokenness was put pack together. My hands were in His hands and I was also weaving.

Out of my belly flowed water that was alive. It pooled around the man. From the right, I pulled down the blood of Christ. Two were necessary.

As all this was happening, little snippets or fragments of images came, all of which were about that being who once was beautiful.

He wasn't one of the highest ranked, but he was close to one who was. He wove energy, understood water, and danced with it. He had such bright eyes of wonder and intense innocent beauty. But he followed the one he was close to and was corrupted. All of these were just fragments of images, nothing whole.

The love I felt for the man, however, was intense, beyond what I could imagine ever feeling. The peices of his soul were returned unto him, put back together, and healed in the water and the blood. All the while, I spoke slow strange words in this language.

I know that this was real. I am left with heavy responsibility. And soo many questions.
