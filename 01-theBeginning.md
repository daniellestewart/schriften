# 1. The Beginning

When I was a child, my mother taught me about Jesus. She says from the time I was able to talk, I would worship Him. I'd sit in the car-seat with my hands raised, tears running down my face, singing to Him. There are pictures of me not quite 2 years old kneeling at my bed praying.

When I was four years old, my parents were at a church event. I remember this: I was sitting with a lot of other big people. The man at the front said a lot of things, but all of them made my chest feel so full and warm. He said Jesus saved me and I knew that was true. I began to cry because that feeling in me was so overwhelming and heavy. My mom asked, "What is wrong, Danielle?" I told her, "I am saved." She couldn't understand me and soon carried me to the bathroom. I was still crying. That feeling was so beautiful and intense. She continued to ask me what was wrong. Finally she understood, "I am saved."

Throughout my childhood, it was so very simple. I loved Jesus. He was my best friend. I didn't have many friends other than Him. He climbed trees with me, rode horse and bike, and visited for as long as I wanted to visit. He loved me and I knew it. My best earth friend at that time was a horse named Buffy. We had so many adventures together and Jesus was always with us. I loved horses, more than anything else in this world. 

One day, I was taking a bath and playing with my toys. The presence of Jesus came to me and He gave me a special language. At first it was just one word, and I knew I should say it often. Soon it became two words. With time, it became many languages that flowed easily and beautifully.

I memorized as much of the bible as I could. I loved learning verses and standing in front of my siblings and mom and repeating them. 

## 1.1 Dreams and Nightmares
From the time I can remember, I had terrible nightmares and visions. Once my brother walked in on me while I was having an open vision of the Father and Jesus in the living room. I felt so guilty, like I was doing something wrong. I didn't tell anyone about this. The nightmares were excruciating, so I taught myself Psalm 91 and recited it before sleep every single night. I knew that His angels would keep charge over me. I knew it. I believed that with all my heart.

When I was five years old, a time of grooming and abuse began with my grandfather. As a child, I locked it all away just to keep myself alive. The abuse continued until I was around 11 years old. The nightmares continued for much longer than that.

But even throughout all of that, Jesus was my best friend. If you were to look at my school notebooks throughout these years, you would see hearts drawn all over the cover: D+J = Forever, I love Jesus, etc. He was everything to me. 

## 1.2 Teen years
The abuse stopped because my grandfather got caught molesting someone else. I was questioned and lied. I still had everything blocked away in myself, but things shook and awakened in me. As the hormones were whipping my body to and fro, so were the nightmares and visions. And so were the thoughts: I am alone. All those words that I spoke every single night from Psalm 91 were not true. He wasn't there for me. He left me alone. The angels didn't bear me up. He didn't deliver me or honor me. He left me. He didn't save me.

So I rejected Him. I stopped telling Him about my day, stopped writing poems to Him, stopped singing to Him. And I began to really spiral. I will summarize in order to make a very long 10 years go by more quickly for you. :)

I became very depressed. All I did was my schoolwork. I was homeschooled, so it was easy for me not to have friends or a social life.  As the nightmares increased, it became very confusing for me to know what was real and what was dream. I was living in a fog and doing quite poorly. I told a couple of people in my family about what I was experiencing, but it didn't go over well. My parents took me to a mental hospital and had me committed. They called it psychotic episodes. I was there for about a week. I didn't feel psychotic, so I didn't take the medication they sent home with me.

After returning from the mental hospital, I decided I needed to find my own way to quiet it all down. I left my parents house at 17 and started doing needle drugs. The first time I ever got high was with a syringe. It wasn't to party, it was to medicate.

## 1.3 Sobriety, University, and Therapy
At 19, I realized I would die if I did not get sober. I found a basement that some friends of my parents let me hide in, and I didn't tell anyone where I was going. I didn't leave that place until I was ready once again to face the world. As I lay in bed shaking and trying not to think about the pain my body was in and how sweet that drug would be, I thought of Psalm 91. I could still quote it, so I did often.

Eventually I got out of the basement, got a job, and started college. I found that I loved math and was quite good at it, so I finished a PhD. All throughout, I had flashbacks, nightmares, and all the rest. I went through many therapists in search of inner healing. Some helped, some hurt. I got married to a man named Russell. He has stuck with me through an awful lot. I am so blessed to have him. 

About six years ago, I found Carl Jung and began to study dreams, symbols, and archetypes from the perspective of analytical psychology. I began to explore inner healing from a new perspective. Given my love of stories, this worked very well for me. I poured myself into this study and made great progress in many ways, but still felt so very empty.

## 1.4 The Inner Child and Growth 
Jung talked about reuniting oneself with their inner child. I began to do exactly that. Most of that felt so natural to me. Climbing trees and talking with them, hearing what they had to say in return. Playing with my horses, crawling under logs, making forts in the woods, believing in the magic of the world again. But I was still empty.

I created beautiful gardens, planted and harvested medicinal herbs, performed rituals based on dreams I had, and talked with a guide that had given its name to me. I explored what psilocibin mushrooms had to say, I performed automatic writing to find hidden wisdom, and I would go into self-induced hypnosis to paint. As I would begin to paint in these states, graphically beautiful and dark images of hellscapes emerged. These were my dreams, yes. I recognized these places.

I served and worshipped myself these years. All the years since I was a teen, in fact. But I still had those beautiful languages that I could speak. I would speak them at times, just to feel them coming out of my spirit. Every time I would speak them, bible verses and worship songs from childhood would get stuck in my head for a few days. I found that intriguing.

## 1.5 An Evening of Crocheting and YouTube
One day in early December 2024, my dad randomly sent me a video that he found on YouTube. "You might like this." It was a guy named Micah Turnbo and he was being interviewed by a Christian mystic. As I crocheted, I listened to someone who had experiences I never heard of from Christians before. I was intrigued.

At the very end of the interview, Micah began talking about the horses in heaven. As I have said before, I have always loved horses. They are so special to me. As Micah was talking about horses, I heard the Father speak to me. It was so clear, so beautiful, and so absolute.

"The same love that you have for horses, I have too. I put it there so that you would look like Me."

It was such a simple thing to say, but with it came that same heavy presence that I once felt whenever He would talk to me. I was overwhelmed with His love. There was no complicated words, no intricate message I had to understand, no steps I had to take. It was just love, pure and beautiful. I began to cry and I told Him, "I missed You." Just as clear as day He said, "I missed you. More than you could ever know."

At that moment, I knew I was forgiven. I was saved. He forgave me for rejecting Him. He forgave me for not trusting that He was with me all those years of abuse. He was with me through all of my life, just waiting for me to hear Him again. For me to run to Him again. And He loves horses like I do! He finds them beautiful like I do. 

I made a deal with Him that I would give Him my entire life. No matter what. I would love Him if He would love me. He quite liked that idea. There was no build-up to being able to hear Him again. His voice was immediately clear to me.

## 1.6 The Beginning of an Adventure
One year ago, I knew deep in myself that the year of 2024 would be a year of preparation for what I was called to do on this earth. All my dreams were pointing to this and getting very insistent that the time was coming. For what, though? What am I called to do? I really did not know. At that time, I was looking to other things for answers and none of them answered that question well at all.

After Father spoke to me, Holy Spirit visited me, and Jesus began to play with me again, I wondered again: what am I called to do? The rest of these writings will bring you along on that journey with me. It has been more beautiful than I can imagine, and its only been a little over three months.
