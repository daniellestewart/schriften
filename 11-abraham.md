# The Heart of God

> After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, "Abraham!"
> "Here I am!" he answered.
> "Take your son," He said, "your only son Isaac, whom you love, go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about."
>
> So Abraham got up early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took with him two of his young men and his son Isaac. He split wood for a burnt offering and set out to go to the place God had told him about. On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. Then Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there to worship; then we'll come back to you." Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac. In his hand he took the fire and the knife, and the two of them walked on together.
>
> Then Isaac spoke to his father Abraham and said, "My father."
> And he replied, "Here I am, my son."
> Isaac said, "The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"
> Abraham answered, "God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." Then the two of them walked on together.
>
> When they arrived at the place that God had told him about, Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood. He bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar on top of the wood. Then Abraham reached out and took the knife to slaughter his son.
>
> But the Angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, "Abraham, Abraham!"
> He replied, "Here I am."
> Then He said, "Do not lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your only son from Me." Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught in the thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son. And Abraham named that place the Lord who provides [*Yahweh-yireh*], so today it is said, "It will be provided on Yahweh's mountain."

I was sitting with my Lord and enjoying His presence. I began to pray to Jesus. I could see Him in the eyes of my heart and I asked Him to teach me the language of His longing. He stood in front of me and I saw His chest. I kissed it and asked if I could help carry His burden. Perhaps my worship could bring healing to Him.

While I prayed, I felt His beautiful presence, but my words, while being genuine, were somewhat abstract. The reality of what I was asking was not present.

Then I began to feel an incredible and intense pain pour into my heart. It was like the most painful broken heart I have ever experienced. I began to weep, my head pounded, my muscles shook. This was not my pain, it was His. The pain did not come in waves. Just as a pitcher pours wine into a cup, the heart pain grew fuller and fuller. I began to see glimpses of what He saw and experienced that brought Him so much pain.

He stood outside of a woman and tried tapping her shoulder, tried calling to her. She glanced over and saw Him, then returned to her television and busyness.

He went to meet a man who was once His friend. He went to their secret place, but the man saw Him there and sheepishly closed the door on Him. He returned to his sin and rejected Jesus.

He went to children that He loves to visit and play with. But parents have given them devices that steal their ability to see Jesus or hear His voice. He sat on the floor and held His face in His hands and wept as the child stared at a screen.

Multitudes of people - one after the other - closed the door or didn't even hear His call.

I gripped the arms of my chair and shook with pain. His pain, even though I knew I was feeling only a small fraction, was so great. So overwhelming. So heart-rending.

I began to speak words I couldn't understand, but somehow these words cried of the pain of loss. They spoke of His desire for His people and the call that echoes across the earth. If only one would hear it.

The entire time I was experiencing this, He stood before me, eyes of pain and love. I laid my head on His chest. Despite the pounding head and pain, I told Him I would take whatever He wanted to give me.

Eventually the pain subsided enough for me to catch my breath. I sang to Him, "I love you Lord, and I lift my voice to worship You..." I then bowed to Him and asked, "Please let me never forget. Please let me always open the door to You. Please forgive me for ever denying You my presence."

I asked Him if there was anything He wanted today. He asked if we could simply spend the day together. "No one else."

Yes, Jesus. Of course. Only us.

Even writing this, my words are so ineffective and weak. I have been so selfish. How many times have I ended our time together when He just wanted to sit with me a minute longer? How many times have I thought, "Oh, I should meet with Him, but I want to do [whatever] first." I have not considered that it hurts Him to be disregarded like I have so many times.

After this experience, my heart was quite tender for Him. I was talking with my Father about it. He said something that I had not considered before.

"I shared my heart with Abraham those days  as he was climbing the mountain with his son. It took him three days to travel to his son's death, just as it took Me three days. When he stretched out his hand, I also needed to stretch out my hand. Abraham felt a portion of My suffering  and shared in My pain. He helped carry My burden until it was no longer something he could help with. As I spared his son, I turned My back on My own Son."

Later as I read the story again, I saw in the footnotes of my bible that the place where God took Abraham was the same geographical location in which Christ was crucified.

## Writing this installment

This entire experience was so personal to me. It was the most intimate thing that my dear God has ever shared with me. It brought me closer to Him in a way I cannot describe or explain. When I asked Him what He wanted me to write about for the next installment and He brought this to mind, I balked. I put it off. It was just so intimately ours... how could I ever come up with words that would do it justice? That could describe His heart...?

In the morning, I take time to sit with a verse and my notebook and ask my Lord questions about the verse. I write down our conversations. This morning, we were discussing Enoch. Father said to me,

> Enoch sought Me more than anyone else has done before him. He learned all he could from his forefathers - including Adam - but could only go to Me to satisfy. He spent every day of his life seeking My face, My heart, My companionship.
>
> Don't forget about the last one: companionship. I desire it too.

I replied, "My beautiful Lord, why is there so much sadness and pain in Your voice when you say that?"

> My children forget that I, too, desire love and truth and partnership. I love quality time and need it just as you do. (Remember, quality is not the same as quantity.)
>
> I long to walk every day with My people. Many of them have no idea I have such desire for their companionship.
>
> As we grow ever closer, I want you to tell them about it. I know at times it feels so personal and intimate to you that you don't want to share it. I understand. There will be things we share together that I'll never ask you to share with others. However, the reason I'll ask you to share - whether writing or speaking - is because My power is on it. Hearing or reading your words will ignite in them experiences with Me.
>
> Enoch also had this decision to make. Many of those around him rejected his words. He did not let the rejection color our experiences together though. That is also an important thing to decide.

I responded, "Do you want me to write about Abraham and Your heart?"

>You already know the answer.

"Do you want me to include --- yes. I know."

>Why is that difficult for you?

"Because it was *so* intimate and personal... No words could capture what You shared with me that day."

> Then the true intimacy will still belong to just us. [He smiled]

"And what if someone spits on it? It is Your vulnerability and Your heart. I couldn't bear someone treating Your heart like that."

>You will beart it, many times in your life. I'll help you bear it, of course. Do not shy from what I command out of fear. Even if it is fear that someone will hurt Me.
>
> I see your heart and know you speak out of love, but it is your love you speak out of, not Mine. My love says that it is worthwhile to open My heart, even if one may spit on it. I'll open My heart as often as possible before it is too late for them.
>
>Do not withhold the potential of My salvation from My people on the chance they'll hurt either of us.

I immediately began to repent. His words revealed in me great pride and arrogance and a complete lack of His love.

"I will write whatever You ask of me, no matter how intimate it feels to me. I will say whatever You request, even if someone may reject You or me."

> This is a very valuable lesson for you. You are beginning to understand what it means to have a heart for My Bride. Your own considerations must often be set aside. It will be difficult, but it is valuable to Me.

He reveals my own heart in the most loving and kind ways.
